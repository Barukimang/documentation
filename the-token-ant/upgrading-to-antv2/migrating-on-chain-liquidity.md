# Migrating on-chain liquidity

ANTv1's on-chain liquidity has historically been concentrated across two platforms:

* Uniswap
* Balancer

## Uniswap

1. Withdraw any ANTv1 liquidity you've provided. In our example, from the [ANTv1/ETH UniswapV2 pool:](https://app.uniswap.org/#/pool/v2)

2\. Use [any of the upgrade paths](./) to upgrade the ANTv1 in your wallet to ANTv2.

3\. You can now add liquidity to the equivalent ANTv2 pools on [Sushi.](https://app.sushi.com/)

## Balancer

1. Withdraw any ANTv1 liquidity you've provided. In our example, from the [ANTv1/WETH 80:20 pool](https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0x2cf9106faf2c5c8713035d40df655fb1b9b0f9b9/):

2\. Use [any of the upgrade paths](./) to upgrade the ANTv1 in your wallet to ANTv2.

3\. You can now add liquidity to the equivalent (or new) ANTv2 pools on Balancer. You can use [Balancer's ANTv2 pools page](https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/explore) to find ANTv2's liquidity pools.

At the moment there is an equivalent ANTv2/WETH 80:20 pool and a new ANTv2/USDC 80:20 pool.
