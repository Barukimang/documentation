# Getting started with Goerli Testnet

In this section, you will learn how to connect and use your web3 wallet on the Goerli Testnet.
{% endhint %}

## **Connect your Web3 wallet to the Goerli Testnet**

{% hint style="info" %}
We recommend using [Metamask wallet](./) as your Web3 wallet.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
The Goerli Network is already set up on your Metamask wallet.
{% endhint %}

Log in to your wallet and select the Goerli Test Network on the dropdown Networks menu.

## **Deposit GoerliETH to your Goerli wallet**

Now you need to load your wallet with enough test-Ether (abbreviated as GoerliETH) to pay for gas. Each transaction on the network requires a gas fee for e.g.:

* transactions for the transfer of funds from your wallet
* the deployment of your Organization
* the interactions within your Organization

#### You can claim GoerliETH on the Goerli Faucet:

* [https://goerli-faucet.mudit.blog/](https://goerli-faucet.mudit.blog/)
* [https://fauceth.komputing.org/?chain=5](https://fauceth.komputing.org/?chain=5)

#### Or post your Goerli Testnet address in the [Aragon Chat #questions-community](https://discordapp.com/channels/672466989217873929/694844628586856469) to receive GoerliETH for free.
