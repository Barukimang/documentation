# Voting on a proposal (anonymous voting enabled)

{% hint style="info" %}
In this section, you will learn how to cast a vote on a voting proposal with **anonymous voting enabled.**
{% endhint %}

## Steps to vote on a proposal

To vote on a proposal in the Aragon Vocdoni Organization you need to receive the URL of the voting proposal. Copy and paste the link into a browser.

All the above details need to be filled in (exactly as in the uploaded voters' list) to be authenticated for a vote.

On the next page, set a **password** for authentication. (The password must have 8 characters or more, with at least 1 uppercase and 1 lowercase).

{% hint style="danger" %}
Write down this password and secure it in a safe place. This password will be asked later when you will cast your vote. Without this password, you can't vote.
{% endhint %}

A message confirms that you are pre-registered.

When the registration period is finished, the vote is automatically opened and you can cast your vote.

Copy and past the URL used for the pre-registration on the browser again.
