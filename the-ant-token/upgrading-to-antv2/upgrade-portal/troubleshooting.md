# Troubleshooting

## My wallet doesn't detect my ANTv2 balance

Your wallet may not immediately detect your upgraded ANTv2 balance. In this case, you need to add the token address (`0xa117000000f279D81A1D3cc75430fAA017FA5A2e)` to your wallet. If you are using a Metamask wallet, you can follow [this guide to add custom tokens](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015489031-How-to-View-See-Your-Tokens-in-Metamask).

If you are using another wallet, you should be able to find the documentation on how to add custom tokens to your wallet's interface.

## My wallet isn't connecting

Your wallet may be experiencing issues. If this issue persists, please reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/aragon).

## My transactions aren't being propagated

You may not have specified a high enough gas price or your wallet may be experiencing issues.

If you are not familiar with the concept of gas on Ethereum, [ethgas.io](https://ethgas.io/) is a great primer. Your wallet should have built-in controls to help adjust the gas price used in your transactions so that they get mined in a timely fashion. If you are using a Metamask wallet you can find more information on how to do this in this [documentation](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015488771-How-to-Adjust-Gas-Price-and-Gas-Limit-).

## My transactions are failing

Please double check that your transaction has specified a high enough gas limit and that your account holds enough ETH. Using 250,000 as the gas limit for any transactions requested by the Upgrade Portal will be sufficient.
