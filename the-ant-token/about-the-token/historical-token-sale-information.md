# Historical token sale

## The public token sale

ANT was initially created and distributed as a result of a [public token sale](https://blog.aragon.org/announcing-the-aragon-network-token-sale-fe83fe36902c) that took place on [May 17, 2017](https://blog.aragon.org/final-token-sale-recap-1ac64ab7cfcd) - starting at [**Ethereum block 3,723,000**](https://etherscan.io/block/3723000) to be exact. Less than 100 blocks later, 275,000 ETH worth of ANT were sold.&#x20;

Added together with ANT sold in the pre-sale, ANT granted to the Aragon Institution (the Aragon Association) and ANT granted to founders and early contributors, the **total initial supply of ANT** after the token sale is **39,609,523.81 ANT**.
