# How can connect my Ledger to the Upgrade Portal?

If your 'old' ANT (ANJ or ANTv1) are on your Ledger, for converting them you can connect your Ledger to Metamask and then upgrade them to v2 in our conversion portal here: [https://upgrade.aragon.org/#/](https://upgrade.aragon.org/#/)&#x20;

Note: Ledger wallet should have automatically upgraded ANT to ANTv2. Please check before starting the conversion process.
