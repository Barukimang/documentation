# I accidentally sent my "old" ANT to an exchange

If you have sent your "old" ANT (ANTv1 or ANJ) to an Exchange, please contact the exchange's support and ask them what can be done.

The exchange's wallets are managed by them and are out of the control of Aragon (in the same way as user wallets).&#x20;
