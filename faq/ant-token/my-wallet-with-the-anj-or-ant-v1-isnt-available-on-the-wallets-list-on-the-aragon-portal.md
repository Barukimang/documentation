# My wallet isn't available on the Upgrade Portal

If your wallet (where you have your ANJ or ANTv1) isn't available in the list of wallets on the Aragon Portal, you can choose an available wallet on the list proposed on the Aragon Portal. There you can create a new account and move the tokens from your wallet to the new wallet. Then proceed with the swap on the portal.&#x20;

Alternatively, you can import your seed phrase into the new wallet, connect the new wallet to the portal and proceed with the swap.
